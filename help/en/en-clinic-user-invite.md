# Adding Doctors and Managing Invitations

To include other doctors who will work in your clinic in the system, you need to send them an email invitation.

**Path:** `My Clinic > TEAM MANAGEMENT`

## Add a New Doctor (Invite)

1. Click **Add Dentist User** at the top-left of the list.
2. In the window that opens, enter the doctor’s details:
   * **Full Name**
   * **Email Address** (the address the invitation will be sent to and used to sign in)
3. Click **Send Invite** (or **Save**).

An activation link will be sent to the doctor’s email address. The doctor can click the link, set a password, and then sign in.

## Manage and Delete Invitations

You can track the status of invitations in the list:

* **Pending:** The doctor hasn’t clicked the link in the email yet.
* **Active:** The doctor has signed in.

**Delete an incorrect invitation:**
If you invited the wrong email address or changed your mind:

1. Find the relevant row in the list.
2. Click **Delete Invite** on the right.

> ⚠️ **Note:** If the invitation email didn’t arrive, ask them to check the **Spam/Junk** folder.
