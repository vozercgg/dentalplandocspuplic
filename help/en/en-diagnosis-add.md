# DentalPlan: Diagnosis and Tooth Selection

This screen is where you build the foundation of the treatment plan by marking the patient’s dental problems (caries, missing tooth, fracture, etc.) on the visual chart.

**Path:** `Cases > [Patient Name] > Diagnosis`

## Add a Diagnosis

1. Click the problematic tooth on the **Tooth Chart** in the center.
2. From the list on the left panel, select the diagnosis (e.g., *Caries*, *Missing*).
3. The selected diagnosis is marked visually on the tooth.

> 💡 **Tip:** To quickly find a diagnosis, use the **Search** box at the top-left.

## Save

After finishing your markings, click **Save Diagnosis** on the right panel.

This saves the diagnoses you selected. Saving diagnoses is required to proceed to the next step: the **Treatment** tab.

## Fix Mistakes

If you made an incorrect selection, use the buttons on the right panel:

* **Clear Selections:** Clears your latest selections that you haven’t saved yet.
* **Full Reset:** Resets the entire tooth chart, including saved items.

> ⚠️ **Note:** If you leave the page without saving, your selections will be lost. When you’re done, make sure to click **Save Diagnosis**.
