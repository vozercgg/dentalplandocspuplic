# Resetting and Updating the Document

If you changed the treatment plan, language selection, or diagnosis data after creating the document, you need to refresh the document.

**Path:** `Cases > [Patient Name] > Document Pages > (Editor)`

## How to Update

1. Click the **Gear (Settings)** icon in the top-left of the editor.
2. Click **Reset Document**.
3. The system takes you back to the **Page Selection** screen.

After this, new data (e.g., newly added **Diagnosis**) will become selectable.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Resetting removes manual edits you made in the editor (custom texts/images). The document is regenerated from the template.
