# Hotel and Transfer Management

Here you define the accommodation and transportation options you offer to patients. The cards you create can be quickly selected in treatment plans when **Add Extra** is used.

**Path:** `Side Menu > Hotels & Transfers`

## Add a New Hotel or Transfer

1. Click **Create New** in the top-right corner.
2. In the window that opens, enter the service details:
   * **Type:** Choose Hotel or Transfer.
   * **Name:** The service name (e.g., *5-Star Hotel Package*).
   * **Image:** Upload a hotel/vehicle photo for display.
   * **Link:** Add the hotel website or location link.
3. Click **Save** to finish.

## Edit or Delete Existing Records

To update or remove a service, use the icons at the top-right of the relevant card:

* **Edit (Pencil icon):** To change the price, image, or name.
* **Delete (Trash icon):** To remove the service from the system completely.

> ⚠️ **Note:** If you delete a hotel or transfer service, it will still appear in past patient plans where it was previously used, but it cannot be selected for new plans.

## Where is it used?

The cards you create here appear in two places:

1. **While creating a Treatment Plan:** When you click **Add Extra**, you’ll see this list.
2. **In PDF Documents:** In the offer document you share with the patient (Extra Services page), the image and description are included automatically.
