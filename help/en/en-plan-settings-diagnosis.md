## Editing Diagnosis Texts

This list contains the diagnoses used in the patient workflow.

1. Find the relevant diagnosis in the list.
2. Edit the **Patient Description** field.

The text you write here is shown to the patient on the “Diagnosis” page inside generated PDF documents. For best results, prefer patient-friendly wording (e.g., “Root tip inflammation”) instead of highly technical terms.

> ⚠️ **Important:** After making changes, don’t forget to click **Save** in the top-right.
