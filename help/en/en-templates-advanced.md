# Cloning and Creating Special Pages

To speed up your design work and build special page structures, you can use the advanced tools in the top-right area.

**Path:** `Side Menu > Templates` (Top-right panel)

## 1) Clone Pages (Cross-language transfer)

You can transfer a design you prepared in one language (e.g., TR) to another language (e.g., EN) with one click.

1. Select your target language (e.g., EN).
2. Click **Clone Pages**.
3. The system copies the design from the source language into the selected language.

> ℹ️ **Note:** After cloning, you usually only need to translate the texts—no need to rebuild the visual layout.

## 2) Create Full Page (Full Page)

Use this for cover pages or any page where you want a full-bleed image. It removes page margins and expands the design to the full page area.

## 3) Create Data Page (Dynamic Content)

Use this for pages where content changes per patient (e.g., treatment list or photo album).

* When you click **Create Data Page**, the system automatically arranges repeating data areas (row height, column structure).
* In most cases, once it’s set, you don’t need to change it again.
