# Page Design and Editing

Each page that forms the PDF document (Cover, Intro, Treatment list, etc.) is listed as a separate card.

**Path:** `Side Menu > Templates`

## Editing Pages

1. Under the page card you want to edit, click **Edit**.
2. In the editor, you can:
   * **Images:** Add your clinic photos or logo.
   * **Text:** Update headings and fixed descriptions.
   * **Colors:** Use color blocks that match your brand.

> 💡 **Tip:** The texts you write here are for the general template. Patient-specific fields (Name, Total Amount, etc.) are filled automatically, so you usually don’t need to change those areas.

## Available Page Types

* **Cover / Back:** The “showcase” pages of the document.
* **Intro:** Clinic introduction and your areas of expertise.
* **Treatment:** Planned procedures and price list.
* **Case Photos:** Area reserved for case photos (e.g., before/after visuals).
* **Animation:** Page that includes the QR code for the treatment animation.
* **Diagnosis:** Tooth chart and diagnosis details (if enabled in your set).
