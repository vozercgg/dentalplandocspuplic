# PDF Template and Language Management

This is the main design center for the offer and treatment-plan PDFs you send to your patients. The settings you configure here become the default base for all newly generated documents.

**Path:** `Side Menu > Templates`

## Language and Template Set Selection

Use the controls in the top-left to choose which design you are editing:

1. **Language Selection:**
   * Select `TR` to edit Turkish documents,
   * Select `EN` to edit English documents.
2. **Template Set:**
   * You can create multiple designs for the same language (e.g., *Classic, Modern, Dark*).

## Set the Default Template

To make the selected language + template set the default for that language:

* Click **Set this Template as Default for ({lang_name})**.

After that, when you create a new document for a patient in that language, the system automatically uses this design.
