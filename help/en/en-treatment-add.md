# Adding a Procedure to a Patient Plan

This is the first step when creating a treatment plan for a patient.

**Path:** `Cases > [Patient Name] > Treatment`

## Add Step-by-step

1. Select the teeth on the tooth chart where the procedure will be applied.
2. In the search bar under the **Treatment** tab, type the procedure (e.g., Filling).
3. Find the relevant treatment in the list.
4. **Click** the treatment.

The procedure is added instantly as a new row in the list. To add the same procedure multiple times (e.g., for 3 teeth), you can click again.

> 👉 **Next step:** To group procedures, see the [Phase Management](./en-treatment-phases.md) document.
