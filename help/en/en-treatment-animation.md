# Creating and Sharing a Treatment Animation

Turn the treatment plan you created into a 3D animation that your patient can easily understand. This feature is especially useful for inviting the patient to the clinic or visualizing the treatment process.

**Path:** `Cases > [Patient Name] > Animation`

## Generate the Animation

1. First, prepare your plan in the **Treatment** tab.
2. From the top menu, click the **Animation** tab.
3. The system automatically generates a 3D animation based on your plan.

> 💡 **Tip:** Any change you make in the treatment plan (adding/removing teeth, etc.) is reflected instantly on the animation screen. If you want to change the order, you can drag-and-drop from the list on the right.

## Add AI Narration

When sending the animation to the patient, you can also add a professional text that explains the treatment.

1. On the animation screen, click **Generate AI Treatment Story**.
2. The AI generates a story and an explanation text suitable for the treatment plan.
3. You can edit and personalize the text as you like.

To send the animation, click **Share & Save Animation** in the top-right corner.
