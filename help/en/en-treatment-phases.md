# Phase Management

Phases are used to group treatments by appointment or workflow step (e.g., "Session 1", "Surgery").

## Add a Phase

1. On the right side of the treatment screen, click **Add Phase**.
2. A new group header will be added to the bottom of the list.

## Name a Phase

1. Click the added **"Phase X"** header.
2. Type the new name (e.g., *Appointment 1*) and save.

## Move Procedures into a Phase

1. **Press and hold** the treatment row in the list.
2. Drag and drop it **under** the relevant phase header.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Phases are only for grouping; they do not affect pricing.
